Add tasks to Nirvana from Quicksilver using the Nirvana Gem.  Here's how you can use this script: 

1) Visit https://github.com/meeech/nirv and follow the steps to install the Nirvana Gem (Terminal -> "gem install nirvanahq")
2) Run "nirv init" and add your username and MD5-sum password to the config file (I used http://md5.gromweb.com/ to convert my password to the MD5 sum).
3) Save the Quicksilver Add to Nirvana Applescript into Library -> Application Support -> Quicksilver -> Actions.

Done!  Now type your task into the first Quicksilver step and type Nirvana Add into the action step.
